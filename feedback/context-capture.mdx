When a player submits feedback via Upview, we don't just send the text. We capture a rich snapshot of the game state to help you debug and balance your game more effectively.

## What's included?

Every submission automatically includes the following data points:

### 🎮 Player Profile
- **Account Age**: Helps distinguish between veteran players and new users.
- **Membership**: See if the user is a Premium subscriber.
- **Submission History**: View all previous feedback from this specific player in one timeline.

### 💻 Technical Snapshot
- **FPS**: Was the game lagging when they reported a "slow combat" bug?
- **Memory**: Is the game nearing its memory limit on mobile devices?
- **Device Type**: Distinguish between Desktop, Mobile, and Console bugs instantly.

### 🌍 World State
- **Server Version**: Know exactly which patch the player was on.
- **Session Duration**: How long had they been playing before they decided to leave feedback?
- **JobId**: Identify if specific feedback is clustered around a particular game server instance.

## Custom Context
As a developer, you can inject your own game-specific context at the time of submission.

```lua
Upview:ShowFeedbackForm(Player, "map_vote", {
    CurrentMap = "volcano_island",
    PlayerKills = 42,
    MatchDuration = 600
})
```

This data is rendered in the **Player Context** sidebar on the Dashboard, allowing you to filter and sort feedback by any criteria you define.
