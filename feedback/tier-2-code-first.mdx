Tier 2 allows developers to keep their form definitions in their codebase. This is ideal for those using **Rojo** or **Git**, as it keeps your UI logic synced with your code version.

## Defining a Form
Instead of using the Dashboard, use the `Upview:DefineForm` method. This will automatically create or update the form on the Upview cloud whenever the server starts.

```lua
local Upview = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.Upview)

Upview:DefineForm("player_survey", {
    title = "Weekly Feedback",
    description = "Help us improve our game!",
    fields = {
        {
            id = "fun_score",
            label = "How fun was the match?",
            type = "StarRating",
            max = 5
        },
        {
            id = "issues",
            label = "Any specific issues?",
            type = "TextInput",
            placeholder = "Tell us more..."
        }
    }
})
```

## Showing the Form
Once defined, you use the same `ShowFeedbackForm` method as Tier 1:

```lua
Upview:ShowFeedbackForm(Player, "player_survey")
```

## Why use the DSL?
- **Version Control**: Catch mistakes in form updates by reviewing code diffs.
- **Dynamic Options**: Use Lua logic to generate dropdown options (e.g., a list of all currently active maps in the server).
- **Auto-Discovery**: Simply calling `DefineForm` is enough to create the form on the dashboard. No manual setup required.
