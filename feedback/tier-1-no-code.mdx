description: "The fastest way to get feedback using the Upview Dashboard."

Tier 1 is designed for teams that want to iterate quickly. You design the form visually on the web, and it appears in your game instantly.

## 1. Create your Form
Head to the **Feedback Forms** section of your Upview Dashboard and click **Create New Form**. Use the drag-and-drop builder to add:
- Star Ratings
- Multiple Choice questions
- Text Inputs
- Conditional logic (e.g., "Show 'Description' only if Rating is < 3")

## 2. Trigger from Lua
Once you have your **Form Slug** (e.g., `bug-report`), you can trigger the form for any player with a single line:

```lua
local Upview = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.Upview)

-- Trigger the form when the player clicks a button
Upview:ShowFeedbackForm(Player, "bug-report")
```

### Passing Custom Context
You can pass additional metadata that will be attached to the feedback on the dashboard:

```lua
Upview:ShowFeedbackForm(Player, "bug-report", {
    Map = "CyberCity",
    Wave = 15,
    Difficulty = "Expert"
})
```

## Key Benefits
- **Zero code changes**: Change questions or styles on the web and the changes sync to players in real-time.
- **Managed UI**: Uses the Upview `UIBinder` to ensure a premium, accessible interface across all devices (Desktop, Mobile, Console).
- **Validation**: Fields are automatically validated (required, min/max, etc.) before submission.
