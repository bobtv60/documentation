Upview forms are designed to look premium by default, but you can customize them to match your game's brand.

## Visual Customization
You can set theme properties either through the **Dashboard** or directly in the **Lua DSL** (`Tier 2`).

```lua
Upview:DefineForm("themed_form", {
    theme = {
        BackgroundColor = Color3.fromRGB(20, 20, 25),
        AccentColor = Color3.fromRGB(139, 92, 246), -- Indigo
        TextColor = Color3.fromRGB(240, 240, 245),
        BorderRadius = 12
    },
    fields = { ... }
})
```

## Available Properties
| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `BackgroundColor` | The main background color of the form modal. |
| `AccentColor` | Used for buttons, star ratings, and progress bars. |
| `TextColor` | The primary text color for labels and headers. |
| `BorderRadius` | Controls the roundness of the corners (in pixels). |
| `FontFamily` | Supports standard Roblox fonts (e.g., "Gotham", "Roboto"). |

## Responsive Layout
Upview's `UIBinder` automatically handles layout changes based on the player's screen size:
- **Mobile**: Forms expand to take up most of the screen with larger touch targets.
- **Desktop**: Forms appear as elegant centered modals.
- **Console**: Input fields are intelligently ordered for controller navigation.
